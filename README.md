# Task List

## Requirements
Create a grouped task list with task dependencies

1. Build a task list UI in React using included design and SVG assets
2. The top level should show a list of task groups w/ # of tasks inside
3. Clicking a group should display the list of all tasks for that group
4. Tasks remain locked until all dependent tasks are complete
5. Clicking a task should mark it as complete or incomplete, unless the task is locked
6. Dependencies that don't point to a loaded task should be ignored

## Installation
